I used http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node100.html to look up ncurses calls. 
Mostly my vlines and a different way to output

I talked to Cole H, Alex E, Drew D, and Kyle R about the different ways to draw the board and move the cursor
I talked to Cole, Alex, and Drew about the different ways to play the game and declare winners.

*******************
To use the program, run the make file,
from there, run 'runMe' in the bin folder

*******************

To play the game use the arrow keys
to place a X or an O press space

When someone wins, there will be a prompt to play again
Press Y or y to play again, press N or n to quit the game
