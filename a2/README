Compile this game with 'make'.
Replace the 'room.txt' file in the root directory (there is my test on there)

To run the program, run this command: 'bin/runMe room.txt'

To navigate the game board use the hjkl keys,
h is left, j is down, k is up, l is right, 
the game uses the character set from rogue,
your movable character is the '@' symbol.

To move to the next room without hitting a door, hit 'n'
once it gets to the 9th room(or if you hit 'q'), the program will exit

If the room is longer than the terminal window, the bottom boarder
will be displayed beside the top boarder.

Sometimes the cursor will not display... run the game again to fix it
